Yeah, I use [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs) as my sole text editor. However, I'm not in the camp that [does everything in Emacs](https://vimeo.com/13158054). It's an interesting idea, but has never proven feasible with me.

Emacs Web Server is one of those interesting projects that can run a web server using Elisp. I have not used Emacs web server, but I starred the repository on GitHub for the novelty.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

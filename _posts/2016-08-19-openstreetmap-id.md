The OpenStreetMap iD Editor was [released on May 7, 2013](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2013/05/07/openstreetmap-launches-all-new-easy-map-editor-and-announces-funding-appeal/), the same day I starred it on GitHub. At the time I had never contributed to [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org)[^1]. I found the [Potlatch](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_2) and [JOSM](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) editors clunky and difficult to use. The iD editor has a much easier learning curve for beginners.

The iD editor can (and has been) extended to custom non-OpenStreetMap uses. The [National Park Service](http://nps.gov) has created a fork of iD editor called [Places Editor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-editor) which is used internally by NPS staff to edit their own map data. [Bryan Housel](https://twitter.com/bhousel) gave a very interesting [presentation](https://t.co/arC1fiMKog) on customing the iD editor at the [2016 State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us) conference.

Every time I think of iD editor, I come back to [this Mapbox article](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/user-friendly-guided-feature-extraction/) showing a theoretical tracing concept. As far as I can tell, this plugin has not been released, but the possibilities are amazing.

[^1]: As a manager of authoritative GIS data, I was (and still am) miffed by the negative attitude of some in the OpenStreetMap community towards data imports.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

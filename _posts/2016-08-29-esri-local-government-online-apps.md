[Esri/local-government-online-apps](https://github.com/Esri/local-government-online-apps)

I work as a GIS Coordinator for a [local government](http://sanjuanco.com){:target="_blank"}, so of course I'm interested in Esri's local government web applications on GitHub. This repository contains two of the configurable web application templates found on ArcGIS Online, [Finder](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/Solutions/s2.html?app=apps2/Finder){:target="_blank"} and [Find, Edit, and Filter](http://www.arcgis.com/apps/Solutions/s2.html?app=apps2/FindEditFilter){:target="_blank"}. These applications have some configurable options out of the box but infinite possiblities by way of the open and free to use source code. I have developed applications based on other open source local government apps from [Esri](http://www.esri.com){:target="_blank"}. They can be a great starting point for beginning developers to learn from.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

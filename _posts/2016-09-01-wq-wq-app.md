The [wq.app](https://wq.io/wq.app){:target="_blank"} is a fascinating concept for developing data collection apps. wq.app includes charts with [D3.js](http://d3js.org){:target="_blank"}, maps with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com){:target="_blank"}, and many other tools for quick deployment. This looks like a good choice for rapid development of web applications. I have not had occassion to use it wq.app yet, but it looks amazing.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

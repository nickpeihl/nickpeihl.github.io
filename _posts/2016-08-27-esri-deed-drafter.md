[Esri/deed-drafter](https://github.com/Esri/deed-drafter){:target="_blank"}

The DeedDrafter repository from [Esri](http://www.esri.com){:target="_blank"} is an application built on the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/){:target="_blank"} for translating metes and bounds from deeds and legal descriptions into cadastral GIS data. The use of [metes and bounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metes_and_bounds){:target="_blank"} is limited to a few states in the U.S. Most states, including my current state of Washington, use the [Public Land Survey System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Land_Survey_System (PLSS)){:target="_blank"} for describing real property.

Because we use the PLSS in Washington, DeedDrafter has little use to me out of the box. However, the source code is available and would a great head start for someone interested in learning how to develop applications on the ArcGIS Runtime SDK. It is encouraging to see Esri, a major player in the GIS software industry, publishing application and library source code on GitHub.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

[driskull/brackets-arcgis-js](https://github.com/driskull/brackets-arcgis-js)

The brackets-arcgis-js repository appears to be abandoned as the [ReadMe](https://github.com/driskull/brackets-arcgis-js/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"} warns that it does not work and there has been no development since December 2013. As I understand it, the goal of the library appears to enable code hints for working with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/){:target="_blank"} in the [Brackets](http://brackets.io/){:target="_blank"} text editor. I do not use Brackets but the concept of [Code Hinting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Code%20Hinting%20Functional%20Specifications){:target="_blank"} is interesting.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

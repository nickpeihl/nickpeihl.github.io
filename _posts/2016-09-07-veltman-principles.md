[Noah Veltman's](http://noahveltman.com/) web development principles is a fascinating repository of tips, tricks, and ideas to consider when making websites. This was one of the first "knowledge" repositories I discovered on GitHub. The way I see it, a knowledge repository is more like a personal wiki than a blog. I use my [knowledge](https://github.com/nickpeihl/knowledge) to keep notes that I want to have handy. But storing it publicly on GitHub means I can share that knowledge with others. I also find Yoshuawuyts' [Knowledge repository](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge) very useful.

Maybe you should start your own?

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

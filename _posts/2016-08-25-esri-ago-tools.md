[Esri/ago-tools](https://github.com/Esri/ago-tools){:target="_blank"}

[ArcGIS Online](http://arcgis.com){:target="_blank"} can be a useful tool for hosting, publishing and managing GIS data in an organization. It offers a lot of options for controlling the hosted data. But sometimes you want more control. The ago-tools Python package includes a number of [examples and tools](https://github.com/Esri/ago-tools/tree/master/samples){:target="_blank"} for administering data, maps, and services on ArcGIS Online. The [updateMapServiceUrlsInWebMaps](https://github.com/Esri/ago-tools/blob/master/samples/updateMapServiceUrlsInWebMaps.py){:target="_blank"} sample was especially helpful to me when we changed the name of several of our map services.

Recently, development on ago-tools has ceased with the focus shifting to the [ArcGIS Python API](https://github.com/esri/arcgis-python-api){:target="_blank"}. Nevertheless, I am encouraged to see that Esri has continued to make more and more tools available as open source libraries on GitHub.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

[FreeRDP/FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP)

I use Ubuntu on my laptop at home and Windows on my work PC. Occasionally, I find that I need a file from my work PC while I'm at home. While I live only four miles from my office now, I lived 60 miles away from my last job. But no matter the distance it is inconvenient to travel to the office solely to retrieve a file or document. It is much more efficient to use Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015(v=vs.85).aspx) to connect remotely to my work PC from home.

FreeRDP was my fourth star on GitHub on April 12, 2012. [FreeRDP](http://www.freerdp.com) is an open source command-line application to use Remote Desktop Protocol to remotely connect to Microsoft Windows PCs. It requires a bit of command line familiarity to use but the manual is pretty clear on all the options.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, a security issue on my remote gateway prevented me from being able to run FreeRDP so I was not able to use it.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

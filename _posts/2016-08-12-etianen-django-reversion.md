I find it difficult to remember why I enter a room sometimes, so it should be no surprise that I have trouble remembering why I starred GitHub repository four years ago. It's also possible that some repositories, while not necessarily changing scope, to add a lot of features in four years. What I do recall is that I was really into the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com){:target="_blank"} web framework at the time.

The django-reversion repository received my third GitHub star on April 12, 2012. Django-reversion is an extension to the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com){:target="_blank"} web framework. Django-reversion provides version control to your Django models. This means you can roll back your model to previous history. If you store your Django project in version control, such as [Git](http://git-scm.com){:target="_blank"} but that only works well for your code. You can migrate model changes to your database forward using [South](http://south.readthedocs.io){:target="_blank"}, but I suspect you'd have trouble migrating to a historic model. This appears to be where django-reversion shines.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

The Django repository received my sixth star on GitHub on April 28, 2012. [Django](http://djangoproject.com){:target="_blank"} is an open source web application framework written in [Python](http://www.python.org){:target="_blank"}. Django first introduced me into the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller){:target="_blank"} application architecture. Django works with many database backends including but not limited to [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org){:target="_blank"} and [SQLite](http://sqlite.org){:target="_blank"}.

With Django I was able to quickly create web sites for collecting and displaying data from consultants and other users. [My first Django application](https://bitbucket.org/npeihl/mshcp-website-hg){:target="_blank"} migrated a species occurrence database from Microsoft Access to a web-based form that enabled scientists to quickly create and view species occurrence data from field inspections. This made collaboration between agencies much easier and more efficient. Lately I have been focusing on front-end web applications so I haven't used Django in several years. But Django still holds a very special place in my heart.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

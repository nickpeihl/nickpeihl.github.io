I starred the arcgisPythonAddins repository on GitHub on November 23, 2013 because I was interested in learning more about add-ins for ArcGIS for Desktop. Versions 10.1 and later of [Esri ArcGIS for Desktop](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop){:target="_blank"} added the ability to create and install [Python](http://python.org){:target="_blank"} add-ins. The arcgisPythonAddins created by [Rowan Geospatial Research Laboratory](http://gis.rowan.edu){:target="_blank"} are great examples of how ArcGIS add-ins work. Check out the source code if you are interested in examples of extending your workflows in ArcGIS for Desktop.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

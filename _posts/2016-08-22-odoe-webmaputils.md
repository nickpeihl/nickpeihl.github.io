excerpt: I starred Rene Rubalcava's webmaputils repository on GitHub on October 16, 2013. Webmaputils was Rene's framework for creating web maps that conform to Esri's web map data specification.

Web maps created on [ArcGIS Online](http://arcgis.com){:target="_blank"} are configured using [JSON](http://json.org){:target="_blank"} format. [Esri](http://www.esri.com){:target="_blank"} has created the [Web Map Data JSON specification](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-web-map-json/#/Web_map_data/02qt0000000q000000/){:target="_blank"} for this configuration. This means you are not always required to use ArcGIS Online to create web maps.

I starred [Rene Rubalcava's](https://twitter.com/odoenet){:target="_blank"} webmaputils repository on GitHub on October 16, 2013. Webmaputils was Rene's framework for creating web maps that conform to Esri's web map data specification. While development has apparently ceased, webmaputils is still a great resource for understanding the process of creating web maps to the Esri specification.

Also, Rene is extremely helpful for beginning and advanced JavaScript developers interested in web maps. Be sure to check out his [blog](http://odoe.net/blog/){:target="_blank"} and his [books on ArcGIS web development](http://odoe.net/blog/products/){:target="_blank"} or ask him lots of questions on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/odoenet){:target="_blank"}. ðŸ˜‡

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

The open source repositories created by the [Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC)](http://gis.utah.gov){:target="_blank"} are amazing resources for the civic developers. The AGRCJavaScriptProjectBoilerplate is an opinionated framework the folks at AGRC use to create web map applications. Reading the source code of this and many other AGRC repositories is a great way to learn and think about application development for local government.

The creation and use of open source software in the public sector isn't unique to the State of Utah. You can now find application developers in many local, state and federal governments. And organizations such as [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org){:target="_blank"} are helping facilitate creation and use of open source applications in local governments around the United States.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

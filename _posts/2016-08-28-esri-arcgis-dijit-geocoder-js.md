[Esri/arcgis-dijit-geocoder-js](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-dijit-geocoder-js)

The [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-api/){:target="_blank"} has caught the ire of many web developers for being based on the [Dojo framework](http://dojotoolkit.org){:target="_blank"} rather than the more ubiquitous [jQuery framwork](http://jquery.com){:target="_blank"}. The choice of framework does not bother me, as I prefer to just use whichever tool is necessary for the job (which [might not need a framework](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/){:target="_blank"}).

I do believe obfuscating the code for the ArcGIS UI components (known as dijits) hinders developers. However, the arcgis-dijit-geocoder-js repository on GitHub is [one of several](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=arcgis-dijit){:target="_blank"} open sourced dijits for the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Having the source code for these dijits makes it easier for developers (especially non-Dojo developers) to understand, manipulate, and develop their own dijits.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

[rec/echomesh](https://github.com/rec/echomesh)

As an owner of a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org) I'm intrigued by small computing. Echomesh, now known as [TimeData](https://timedata-org.github.io/), is a library for using arrays of small computers like Raspberry Pi to control external devices such as lights and sounds. I suspect this means you could replace those large soundboard and lighting controllers often used at concerts with one or more arrays of cheap Raspberry Pis.

Although I would be really interested if I could use Echomesh or TimeData to do something like this.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

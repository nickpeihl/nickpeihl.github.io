[applegrew/django-select2](https://github.com/applegrew/django-select2)

[Select2](https://select2.github.io) uses jQuery to create fancy dropdown select boxes in your web applications. [Django-Select2](http://django-select2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a drop-in integration of Select2 for your [Django](http://djangoproject.com) web apps. I starred the Django-Select2 repository on GitHub on July 23, 2012 because I found it very useful for my Django input forms. Select boxes using the Select2 library include a [search box for typing in and quickly choosing one or more values](https://select2.github.io/examples.html#single). Select2 boxes [load data from remote sources](https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data-ajax) where a normal select box might be too static.

There are a number of other features of Select2, so I highly recommend checking out all the examples [here](https://select2.github.io/examples.html).


*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

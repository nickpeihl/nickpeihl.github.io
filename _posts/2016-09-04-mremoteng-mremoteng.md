Tabs in web browsers have changed the way we use the internet. So why not change the way we do remote server administration? [mRemoteNG](http://www.mremoteng.org/) is open source software for managing remote desktop protocols. I have used mRemoteNG for quickly connecting to and administering several remote Windows servers. But you can also add other connections like VNC and SSH.

I haven't used mRemoteNG much lately as I've reduced the number of servers I administer. But the project is very useful and interesting.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

I starred [Mayan](http://www.mayan-edms.com) on GitHub on April 12, 2012 while Mayan was still very young. Mayan is an open source electronic document management system (EDMS). My [employer at the time](http://cvag.org) had just started using [Laserfiche](http://laserfiche.com) for document management. Laserfiche works pretty well, but is a classic case of vendor lock-in. Mayan does not rely on proprietary storage formats and prides itself on vendor agnosticism. I installed and used Mayan in a test environment in 2012 and was very pleased with the web-based solution. However, I was not able to use Mayan in production since my employer was already locked in to another EDMS.

I am very happy to see that Mayan has evolved over the past four years into a viable business model while still remaining open source. I strongly recommend reviewing Mayan when looking for document management systems.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

Ideally a webpage is simple so the user has no trouble navigating it. But sometimes, we need to add complexity with might not be immediately obvious or may be confusing to the user. [Intro.js](http://introjs.com){:target="_blank"} is a library for adding simple tutorials and introductions to webpages. I use intro.js on my county's [Polaris](http://sjcgis.org/polaris){:target="_blank"} web application to assist new users with understanding the complexities of Polaris. To see it in action, select "Tutorial" under the "Help" button.

I strongly recommend following the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle){:target="_blank"} when building your website or web applications. Your user should easily understand how to navigate and use your website without much instruction. However, Intro.js is a possible solution for complex and confusing web sites.

*"Why I starred" is a series of articles describing projects I star on GitHub and why I found them interesting. My hope is that you'll find them interesting as well.*

I'm incredibly lazy. Ask anyone in my family. I'll do almost anything to get out of mundane chores such as cleaning the dishes and mowing the lawn.

But laziness inspires innovation. Humans invented dishwashers and riding lawnmowers because we're lazy.

My first real interest in programming was also inspired by laziness. I was given a series of 120 ArcMap MXDs which needed to be exported to PDFs. This meant having to open each MXD one at a time and click File - Export to PDF - Save. And I didn't have a powerful desktop so I would have to reboot about every ten MXDs. This was extremely irritating.

So I started doing research on how to speed things along. I discovered someone else who had a similar problem. He posted Python code he'd written to automate the process. With a little tweaking and reading help docs, I was able to re-use the code to automate the export process for all 120 MXDs. And, since I was using Python code that didn't require all the GUI overhead of ArcMap, I never had to reboot!
